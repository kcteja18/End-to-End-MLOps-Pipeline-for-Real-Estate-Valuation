# End-to-End-MLOps-Pipeline-for-Real-Estate-Valuation
This project implements a complete, end-to-end MLOps pipeline to automatically train, evaluate, and package a machine learning model for predicting California housing prices. The core focus is on automation and reproducibility, bridging the gap between model development in notebooks and a production-ready, deployable asset.
